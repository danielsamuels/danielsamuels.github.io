I've been listening to a lot of Spotify radio this week and have discovered a variety of new artists and songs. Here's a couple I particularly liked this week:

* [AlunaGeorge - Your Drums, Your Love](https://open.spotify.com/track/6xCKQpMuwoHIIjx4xJyaO3)
* [Kiesza - Sound of a Woman](https://open.spotify.com/track/5m2BwIt8U76VZSWpOW2ef7)

All of the songs I feature on this blog will be added to my [weekly favourites](https://open.spotify.com/user/danielsamuels/playlist/6ePxs1LAPCNDe6LyKwVIPe) playlist, allowing you to listen to them all at any time.
