*Onespacemedia's lead developer, Dan Samuels, started coding at the tender age
of 14 and worked as a freelance programmer while still at school. A veteran
coder, Dan has experience in a multitude of programming languages and a wide
portfolio of websites for companies large and small. Here, Dan gives us an
insight into his role and reveals his hidden talent!*

### Describe your role at Onespacemedia
I act as the go-to person when any of the developers are having issues with
their code, have questions on implementation, need help with servers etc.  I
write a lot of the management software we use to provision servers, commit
code.  Alongside all of that I work on client projects - typically the more
complicated ones - to deliver to our high standards of design and technical
functionality.

### What does a typical day at work look like for you?
I wake up in the morning at about 7:30, I read through all of my emails,
respond to anything I need to then head into the office for around 9:20.  When
I get in I check my emails again, respond to any support tickets, take care of
any urgent tasks which have come up and catch up with the team.  I then look
at the work I have on for the day and come up with a plan, which could be to
have a certain feature complete or fix a certain segment of bugs. Throughout
the day I’m constantly in communication with the other developers, helping
them out by answering questions or reviewing code.

### What are the key skills you need to be a web developer?
A strong logical mind, good problem solving skills with the ability to think
about different solutions to the same problems and then evaluate the merits of
each of them against each other.  Being able to adapt to change and keep
progressing on a personal level is key - if you stay rooted in one technology
stack and never look outside then you’re never going to grow as an individual.
Diversity is a good thing.

### What tools do you use to help you do your job?
The main tools I use are Chrome, Sublime Text 3 and iTerm 2. Chrome is an
obvious choice for anyone making websites; the developer tools are really
unmatched by any other browser on the market at the moment.  Sublime Text is a
beast of a text editor, I have it customised and tuned to my needs so I can be
efficient and fast when working on projects.  I know a lot of developers shun
applications like Sublime in favour of older applications such as vim or
emacs, but I’ve never really enjoyed working in that way.  iTerm 2 is just a
great replacement for the default Terminal.app in OS X, the main feature I use
is split panes with a typical iTerm window having 3 panels at the same time,
one for the Django development server, one for Compass/SASS and the other for
running ad-hoc commands.

### What’s the secret to developers and designers working well together?
I think you have to understand the complexities of each other’s roles -
designers need to know what is actually possible to build and developers need
to understand design decisions and work with the designers to iterate and
improve based on the combined knowledge.  You actually pick up aspects of
these skills just by being around people who are great at their jobs. I’ve
designed a couple of little side projects (such as my [personal
website](http://danielsamuels.co.uk/)) and they look much better than they
would have done if I had designed them 2-3 years ago.

### What do you like most about your job?
That I have a variety of different problems to solve and that there’s always
something to do.  At the moment I’m working on a bunch of migration scripts to
move some of our websites from one hosting provider to another and I’m
learning a lot of new skills and technologies along the way.  It’s also great
to be on the bleeding edge of technology, trying out new frameworks, playing
with new toys and just generally having fun doing what I do.  It’s nice to
have the freedom to be able to experiment with new services, to be able to
change procedures and improve workflows - it means the whole team benefits and
becomes more efficient over time.

### What are the biggest challenges of your job?
Keeping on top of my own work while still providing assistance to the other
team members would probably be the biggest thing.  I have a lot of intense
work where I have to get my head down and solve some tricky things, but I also
need to be available if any of my other team members need help.  I think it’s
important for a team leader to be someone who is also on the front lines,
someone who is actively pushing out work alongside them - not someone who just
looks down at everyone else doing work and just pushes paper around.

### Which project(s) are you most proud of?
Technically [Churchill College](https://www.chu.cam.ac.uk/) was my biggest
project and it has some great tech in it.  I always look back at projects
after being off them for a little while and think about how I could have done
things better - I don’t expect that to ever change as I’m constantly learning
new things and improving my implementations of solutions.

### Tell us one thing about yourself that your colleagues don’t know... 
I’m not sure there’s much that people don’t know about me to be honest!  I
guess the only thing might be my achievements within the nerdy World of
Warcraft.  I play at a fairly high level, typically within the top 200 or so
in the world (out of the 7+ million or so people who play), it requires a lot
of dedication and a fair bit of skill.  I have a ton of fun playing and I’ve
travelled across Europe meeting the people I play with.
